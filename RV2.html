        <h2> PERCEPTION MANAGEMENT </h2>
        
        <p class="perception">
            Perception is how we think about a particular person, situation, event, or anything for that matter based on the 
            stimuli we receive and the feelings and thoughts that we have about that particular thing. Perception means what we want to see
            and sometimes what we want to see has nothing to do with the truth.Life is alll about perceptions,positive vs negative.
            Whichever we chose will affect us and more than that reflect our outcomes.

        <div class="reality">PERCEPTION AND REALITY ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS</div>
        
        <div class="p1">
            
            Life is completely based on our perception. Our perception is made on the basis of our opinion. Opinion comes from thoughts
            and thought comes from our mind.So by simply changing our mind we can change our life.

            But once the perception is made it is difficult to change it.Once we change our perception of things we can change our reality. We all have lived different lives,
            in different environments and among different thinking people,we all have different views. And this is an important thing to understand
            because we sometimes become sad when other people don't believe the way we believe.Must remember that your perception is your
            perception . Do not confuse it with "facts" and "reality" . Wars have been fought and millions have been killed because of the inability 
            of men to understand the idea that everybody has different viewpoint.

        <div class="p2">
           YOUR PERCEPTION OF ME IS A REFLECTION OF YOU; MY REACTION TO YOU IS AN AWARENESS OF ME
        </div>
        <DIV class="p3">
              Important thing to undestand is once we fix ourself with our perceptions we lose the ability to fly. People only understand 
              things from there level of perception. It's like a tool which is pointed on both ends.

        </DIV>
        <div class="p4">
            WE DO NOT SEE THINGS AS THEY ARE , WE SEE THINGS AS WE ARE.
