        <h2> LEADERSHIP QUALITIES </h2>
        <div class="leader">
            Leadership is the ability to inspire a team to achieve a certain goal.It is also how you, as an individual, choose to lead your life. The definition of leadership is to influence,
            inspire and help others become their best selves, building their skills and achieving goals along the way. You don't have
            to be a CEO, manager or even a team lead to be a leader. Leadership is a set of skills and a certain psychology that
            anyone can master. Leadership is not a zero-sum equation. When one person harnesses their powers to lead, it strengthens
            the leadership opportunities of others, rather than diminishing them. That’s because the ultimate definition of leadership
            is empowering others to become effective leaders as well. That’s why many iconic leaders have incredible mentors they cite 
            for their success. As one person begins to embrace their role as a leader, they inevitably connect with others who have 
            already mastered the art of leadership.<br>

        <h3 class="heading">What makes a good leader?</h3>
        <div class="leader1">
            The best leaders in the world all have a distinct purpose in mind before they take action. Purpose makes us resilient and 
            strong. Without that purpose, you’re much more susceptible to failure, prolonged ruts and depression. That’s because 
            purpose is what sustains us when things get tough – and things will always get tough. When you want to develop effective 
            leadership skills, turn toward the purpose that drives you. Your purpose is the juice that will drive you to keep going 
            when you face the obstacles and challenges that are so inevitable of any worthwhile journey. It’s what will pick you up and 
            uplift others around you whenever setbacks present themselves. It’s your energy. It’s Kryptonite for defeat and 
            discouragement, and it’s what will give you focus and direction amid the chaos. In other words, your purpose is the North 
            Star of leadership.

        <div class="quote1">
            LEADERS DON'T CREATE FOLLOWERS.THEY CREATE MORE LEADERS.   
        </div>
        <div class="quote2"> A LEADER TAKES A LITTLE MORE OF HIS SHARE OF BLAME AND LITTLE LESS OF HIS SHARE OF CREDIT</div>
        <div class="leader2">LEADERSHIP IS AN ACTION , NOT A POSITION</div>
        <p class="leader3">
             if your actions inspire others and motivate others to dream more,learn more and become more. you are a leader.
             A leader is not a dealer of money or products , he a dealer of hope inspiration and gratitude.A ture leader has respect
             for self,respect for others and responsibility of their actions.He has the confidence to stand alone, has the courage to 
             make decisions without being influenced by others opinion and has compassion to listen to needs of others.

    <p class="leader4"> It is not necessary that u have to inherit all of these qualities in order to be called a leader. Actually a leader never cares about
        the qualities . They are themselves reflected in their thoughts,decisions,behaviour and actions.Leadership is all about one Life
        inspiring the other.
